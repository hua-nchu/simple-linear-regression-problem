# Simple Linear Regression Project: Detailed Execution Plan

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop a web application that demonstrates a simple linear regression model. The application will allow users to interact with the model by adjusting its parameters. The project will follow the CRISP-DM methodology.

## 2. CRISP-DM Phases

### 2.1. Business Understanding
*   **Objective:** Create an educational tool to visualize and understand simple linear regression.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Implement a linear regression model in Python.
    *   Develop a web interface using Streamlit.
    *   Allow users to customize the dataset by modifying:
        *   Slope (`a`) of the line `y = ax + b`.
        *   Intercept (`b`) of the line.
        *   Amount of random noise in the data.
        *   Number of data points.
    *   Display the generated data, the regression line, and the model's performance metrics.
    *   The development process and prompts will be documented.

### 2.2. Data Understanding
*   The data will be synthetically generated.
*   It will consist of a set of (x, y) pairs.
*   The relationship between x and y will be linear, with some added noise.
*   The user will control the parameters of the data generation process.

### 2.3. Data Preparation
*   **Data Generation:**
    *   Generate `x` values (e.g., a sequence of numbers).
    *   Generate `y` values based on the formula `y = ax + b + noise`.
    *   The `noise` will be generated from a normal distribution.
*   **Data Splitting:** For a more robust evaluation, the data could be split into a training set and a testing set, but for this simple visualization, we might perform regression on the full dataset.

### 2.4. Modeling
*   **Model:** Simple linear regression.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Use a library like `scikit-learn` (`LinearRegression` model) to perform the regression.
    *   The model will be trained on the synthetically generated data.
    *   The model will learn the optimal values for the slope and intercept from the data.

### 2.5. Evaluation
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    *   R-squared (R²) score
*   **Visualization:**
    *   Plot the generated data points.
    *   Plot the original "true" line (from user parameters).
    *   Plot the fitted regression line from the model.
    *   Display the calculated evaluation metrics on the web interface.

### 2.6. Deployment
*   **Framework:** Streamlit will be used for its simplicity and speed in creating data apps.
*   **Interface:**
    *   Create sliders or input fields for the user to adjust `a`, `b`, noise, and the number of points.
    *   A main panel to display the plot.
    *   A section to show the metrics (MSE, R²).
*   **Deployment Steps:**
    *   Develop the Streamlit application locally.
    *   The application will be a single Python script (`app.py`).
    *   Instructions on how to run the application locally will be provided.
    *   (Optional) Deploy to a service like Streamlit Cloud.

## 3. Project Tasks and Timeline (High-Level)
*   **Week 1:**
    *   Set up the project environment.
    *   Implement the data generation logic.
    *   Implement the linear regression model.
*   **Week 2:**
    *   Develop the Streamlit web interface.
    *   Integrate the data generation and modeling parts with the UI.
    *   Add visualizations and metrics display.
*   **Week 3:**
    *   Testing and debugging.
    *   Refine the user interface.
    *   Write documentation and instructions.
