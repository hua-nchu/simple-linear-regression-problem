# Project Plan 3: Enhanced Linear Regression App

## 1. Goal
Evolve the simple linear regression application into a more robust and feature-rich tool. This version will focus on improving user interaction, model evaluation, and code quality.

## 2. New Features
-   **File Upload:** Allow users to upload their own CSV files for regression analysis.
-   **Enhanced Evaluation:** Display more detailed evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE) and residual plots.
-   **Polynomial Regression:** Add an option to perform polynomial regression and compare it with simple linear regression.

## 3. Code Quality and Maintainability
-   **Unit Tests:** Implement unit tests for the data generation and model training functions.
-   **Code Refactoring:** Refactor the code for better organization and readability.

## 4. Deployment
-   **Containerization:** Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application for easier deployment.
