# Project Execution Log (Todo)

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Logic

- [x] Set up project environment.
  - [x] Create `requirements.txt` file with dependencies (`streamlit`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`).
  - [x] Install dependencies.
- [x] Implement the data generation logic in a Python script.
- [x] Implement the linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.

## Phase 2: Streamlit Application Development

- [x] Create the main application file (`app.py`).
- [x] Develop the Streamlit UI with sliders for user input.
- [x] Integrate the data generation logic into the app.
- [x] Integrate the linear regression model into the app.
- [x] Add data visualization (scatter plot of data, regression line).
- [x] Display evaluation metrics (MSE, RÂ²).

## Phase 3: Finalization

- [x] Test the application thoroughly.
- [x] Add comments and documentation to the code.
- [x] Write a `README.md` with instructions on how to run the app.
