# Project Plan: Simple Linear Regression Web App

## 1. Business Understanding
- **Goal:** Create a web application to demonstrate a simple linear regression model.
- **Objective:** The application should visualize the linear regression process and allow users to interact with the model's parameters.
- **Success Criteria:** A deployed web application that fulfills all the functional requirements.

## 2. Data Understanding
- **Data Source:** The data will be synthetically generated.
- **Data Generation:** The application will generate data points based on the linear equation `y = ax + b` with added noise.
- **User Interaction:** Users will be able to control the parameters `a` (slope), the amount of noise, and the number of data points.

## 3. Data Preparation
- The generated data will be split into training and testing sets.

## 4. Modeling
- **Model:** A simple linear regression model will be implemented in Python.
- **Implementation:** The model will be trained on the generated data to find the best-fit line.

## 5. Evaluation
- The model's performance will be visualized by plotting the regression line against the data points.
- Key metrics like R-squared could be displayed.

## 6. Deployment
- **Framework:** The application will be built using either Streamlit or Flask.
- **Deployment:** The final application will be deployed as a web service.

## 7. Documentation
- The process will be documented following the CRISP-DM methodology.
- The documentation will include prompts and a description of the process, not just code and results.
